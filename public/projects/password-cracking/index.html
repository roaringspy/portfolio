<h3 id="the-objective">The Objective</h3>
<p>The goal was to gain hands-on experience with industry-standard password cracking tools and to understand the computational challenges and strategies involved in recovering passwords from captured hashes and live services.</p>
<h3 id="the-process--tools">The Process &amp; Tools</h3>
<p>I used a combination of tools within a controlled lab environment to perform both offline and online attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offline Attacks:</strong> Used <strong>John the Ripper</strong> and <strong>Hashcat</strong> to perform dictionary and brute-force attacks against password hashes (e.g., <code>bcrypt</code>). This involved leveraging wordlists and custom rule sets to efficiently crack the hashes.</li>
<li><strong>Online Attacks:</strong> Used <strong>Hydra</strong> and the <strong>Metasploit Framework</strong> to simulate brute-force attacks against live services like FTP and SSH on a vulnerable target machine.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-learnings">Key Learnings</h3>
<p>This project solidified my understanding of secure password storage and the importance of implementing rate limiting and account lockout policies to defend against online brute-force attacks.</p>
